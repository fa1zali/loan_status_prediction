### Project Title
**Loan Status Prediction using Support Vector Machine**

### Description
Support Vector Machine is a supervised classification algorithm where we draw a line between two different categories to differentiate between them.

For this project, we will be building a machine learning model to classify whether the person gets a loan or not based on information provided by the loan applicant included in the dataset. Our goal is to work through this notebook by collecting data, preprocessing it, splitting it into testing and training datasets, train the model and evaluate the accuracy of our model.

### Files used
We used the following dataset available on Kaggle to work on this project:

* [Loan Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)

The datasets consists of loan applicant details and one target variable, Loan_Status. Predictor variables includes Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

### Credits
Thanks to Kaggle for teaching me ML :sparkles: :heart: :sparkles:
